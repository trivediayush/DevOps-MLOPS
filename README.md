# 🚀 DevOps & MLOps Daily Journal

> “Learning is not a race, it’s a journey. Every day counts.”  

Hi there! Welcome to my **DevOps + MLOps daily journal**, where I capture everything I learn, experiment with, and build in my journey as a DevOps/MLOps engineer.  

This repo is **my living notebook** — updated daily with hands-on learnings, scripts, pipelines, cloud experiments, and ML deployment projects. If you’re here, expect **practical insights, real-world examples, and progress that evolves day by day**.
